# Three WiFi Meters

<img src="images/hero-sm.gif" width=720px/>

The Three WiFi Meters are three ways of experiencing WiFi networks, each attempts to disclose properties of this near ubiquitous technology. They are built for the [ESP8266](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266) or [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32) using the [Approximate](https://github.com/davidchatting/Approximate) and [YoYoWiFiManager](https://github.com/interactionresearchstudio/YoYoWiFiManager) Arduino libraries.

Measure the signal strength of your router around the house with the [Signal Strength Meter](SignalStrength).

Watch an individual device's use of the network with the [Device Wheel](DeviceWheel).

See the traffic on your home WiFi network with the [Traffic Monitor](TrafficMonitor).

## Limitations
The meters work with 2.4GHz WiFi networks, but not 5GHz networks - as neither ESP8266 or ESP32 support this technology.

## A Little History
The Three WiFi Meters are inspired by multiple sources, not least Natalie Jeremijenko's Live Wire (also known as Dangling String) [(Weiser and Brown, 1995)](https://web.archive.org/web/19970624041814/http://www.powergrid.com/1.01/calmtech.html) and the Tangible Media Group's Pinwheels [(Dahley, Wisneski and Ishii, 1998)](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/pinwheels/).
